      "##1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 \" or 5x7 \" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 \" photos once in a while . \n",
      "##2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that . \n",
      "##i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily . \n",
      "##3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings . \n",
      "##4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much . \n",
      "##depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models . \n",
      "##nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews . \n",

      "indoor picture[-1]##1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance . \n",
      "delay[-2][u]##2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow . \n",
      "picture[-2]##3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture . \n",
      "##all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints . \n",
      "##try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems . \n",
      "##whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty . \n",
      "##and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness . \n",

      "the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor ; not major ones though ,. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can ' t be stopped .would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software \" nikon view \" which reads the images date ; time from the images meta - data .so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .in that too , there is n ' t a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image. images taken indoor were n ' t so clear .you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit. lens cap is a really annoying. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately \" fine **\" picture quality \" image size : 1600 .. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can ' t avoid that .but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close - up shooting capability .i would rate this is 4 . 5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix .\n",

      "i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world .nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .here were my requirements in a digital camera :1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 \" or 5x7 \" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 \" photos once in a while .2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n ' t comfortable with that .i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built - in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n ' t used it much .depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium ; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .a few things that might make it even better :1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .\n",

      "with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful \" scene \" mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc . , are endless .the movie mode is also working great .the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on \" normal \" resolution .i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .even at the \" normal \" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a \" digital \" .the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of \" juice \" .i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an \" outlet environment \" .over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !\n",

      "after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .i currently own an olympus d - 550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .i ' m sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it ' ll perform well in lower light settings .\n",

      "we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !we got a 256mb card , and have been hard - pressed to fill it over a weekend .the only drawbacks that i have noticed :it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .so , it ' s a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .it does not have an auto - focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low - light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .i set the camera to the \" manual \" mode for one main reason :in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .in manual , you can set it to \" single af \" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !it is easy to \" focus \" in on the drawbacks , so do n ' t think i hate this camera .it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general - to moderate snapping .for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .they take excellent macro shots as well .the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .\n",

      "i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m - 4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user - friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .i particularly like the \" txt \" file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take .the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it ' s 2x as faster as the regular cf card .consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it ' s well worth the little extra money .an extra rechargeable en - el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into \" out of battery \" situation .use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .one thing puzzles me is that for \" fine and 2200 + \" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130 - 140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1 . 2 mb , the math does not add up .i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1 . 2 mb / per .anybody can explain that ?a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .\n",

      "first of all , let ' s start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep - up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .for three months , i ' ve researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands - on in - store test drives .and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .the shutter lag is on par with what i ' ve experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .uploading the images to my windows - based pc is very fast and simple .the only drawbacks i ' ve encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i ' ve found this to be a problem with all cameras with built - in flashes that i ' ve used even on a nikon slr .right now , i ' m researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that ' s designed for digital cameras .2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .an extra for a back - up battery would be a good investment .3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .i ' ll still use my photosuite for editing .one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .in summary , i love this camera and would whole - heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .i ' ve picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .i bought a digi - slave dsf - 1s flash unit .i do n ' t use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .i also got a ur - e 4 step down ring adapter , lc - e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n ' t fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .\n",

      "i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .it ' s easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it ' s an excellent camera to grow into .it ' s light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .i ' m amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .8mb for a camera like this is a joke .a card with more memory is a must .a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .\n",

      "if you do any research into digital cameras , you ' ll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .these are the reasons i think it ' s great :1 it has all the features an amatuer photo - enthusiast would want .2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they ' re still easy to use .4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .5 for \" digital film \" it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .6 the nikon coolpix line is a well - established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .7 picture quality is excellent .8 battery life is excellent .9 3x built - in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .10 great price for all the features .here ' s what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :1 no direct firewire to the camera .there is usb , though .2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide - angle -- wc - e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .this does n ' t affect the picture , of course .you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture .it ' s no problem for me personally .3 battery has to be removed to recharge .4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery ' s out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .5 two different adapters -- ur - e 4 and ur - e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses .most of these \" annoyances \" , though , are comparable to what you ' ll find on other cameras in this price range .\n",
